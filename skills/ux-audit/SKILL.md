# UX Audit — suite roll-up

Run the auditor suite against one target and merge the results. By default this fans out to
usability, accessibility, and cuj; web performance is opt-in (add `--only web-performance` or
`--all`). This is the fan-out the
[report contract](../usability-audit/references/report-contract.md) was built for: every
auditor writes the same schema into `.ux/audits/`, so their reports are comparable and can be
rolled up into a single verdict.

Two native auditors plus two wrapped from **[web-quality-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/web-quality-skills)**
(the same-author companion to `agent-skills`, a coherent suite of web-quality checks):

| Auditor | Source | Frameworks | Report `auditor` |
|---------|--------|------------|------------------|
| Usability | native `skills/usability-audit` | Nielsen / Shneiderman / AI / NPCIS | `usability` |
| Accessibility | wrap `web-quality-skills:accessibility` | WCAG 2.2 | `accessibility` |
| Web performance | wrap `web-quality-skills:performance` (+ `core-web-vitals`) **(opt-in — excluded from the default bundle; add via `--only web-performance` or `--all`)** | Core Web Vitals | `web-performance` |
| Critical user journeys | native `skills/audit-cuj` **(conditional — needs `.ux/cujs/`)** | the host's own CUJ files | `cuj` |

> Extensible: `web-quality-skills` also ships `seo` and `best-practices`; add them as
> future suite members the same way (register their frameworks in
> [`scripts/validate_report.py`](../../scripts/validate_report.py)).

## Inputs

- `target` — a URL (preferred; a11y and web-perf need a render) or a repo path. Omit to
  infer from the running dev server / repo.
- `--scope` — narrow to a flow or area, shared by all auditors.
- `--only <list>` — run a subset, e.g. `--only usability,accessibility`. Default (no
  `--only`): usability, accessibility, and cuj — **web performance is excluded (opt-in)**.
  Naming `web-performance` in `--only` runs it.
- `--all` — run every available auditor, **including web performance**.
- `--mode` — passed through to auditors that support it (usability).

## Workflow

1. **Discover available auditors.** Usability is always available (native). For
   accessibility and web performance, check whether the wrapping skills
   (`web-quality-skills:accessibility`, `web-quality-skills:performance`) are installed.
   **Web performance is also opt-in**: even when installed, it runs only when named in
   `--only` or when `--all` is passed — it is *excluded from the default bundle* (its
   metrics are typically dev-mode / localhost lab numbers, not production Core Web Vitals).
   When it is not opted into, record it as skipped with the reason `"web performance is
   opt-in; run with --only web-performance or --all"`, exactly as the CUJ skip is disclosed.
   The CUJ auditor (`audit-cuj`) is native but **conditional**: it runs only when the host
   has authored journeys — `.ux/cujs/` exists and is non-empty. **Skip any auditor that is
   unavailable — a wrapped skill not installed, `.ux/cujs/` absent/empty, or web performance
   not opted into — and record it as skipped with a note giving the reason** in the roll-up
   (for CUJ: `"no CUJs authored; run /ux-spec"`). A missing, skipped, or opt-in-not-requested
   auditor must never read as a clean pass. Honor `--only` and `--all`.

2. **Fan out.** Run each selected auditor against the same `target`/`--scope`:
   - **Usability** — invoke the native `usability-audit` skill; it already writes a
     contract report.
   - **Accessibility** — invoke `web-quality-skills:accessibility`; capture its WCAG
     findings.
   - **Web performance** *(only when opted in via `--only web-performance` or `--all`)* —
     invoke `web-quality-skills:performance` (and `core-web-vitals`); capture its findings,
     respecting its metric-honesty rule (unmeasured = potential, never fabricated).
   - **Critical user journeys** — invoke the native `audit-cuj` skill; it replays the
     host's `.ux/cujs/` and already writes a contract report. It honors its own
     static-vs-live honesty rule (a static run cannot produce a verified pass).

3. **Normalize into the shared contract.** For each wrapped auditor, write a
   contract-conforming report at `.ux/audits/<auditor>-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>.md` — same
   frontmatter schema, body layout, and appendix. **Map each tool's severity onto the
   0–4 scale**:
   - **Accessibility (WCAG):** blocker on a core flow / Level A name-role-value failure →
     3–4; Level AA (e.g. 1.4.3 contrast) → 3; minor/AAA or edge → 2; cosmetic → 1.
   - **Web performance:** a Core Web Vital in the "poor" band (measured) → 3; "needs
     improvement" → 2; a structural anti-pattern with only *potential* impact → 1–2,
     labeled potential per the metric-honesty rule.
   - **Omit severity 0** (non-problems), same as usability.
   Set `auditor` and `frameworks` per the table above; carry the tool's evidence
   (screenshots, `file:line`, measured metrics) into the Evidence field.
   The **native** auditors (usability, `cuj`) already emit contract reports — no external
   remapping. **CUJ carries one exception the roll-up must respect: `total: 0` is a *pass*
   (every journey verified clean), not "found nothing".** Read the CUJ report's
   executive-summary counts and `frameworks` list to tell a clean pass from a run that
   verified nothing (`frameworks: [cuj-contract]` alone signals the latter), and never
   fold a *skipped* CUJ run into the passed column.

4. **Append the index.** Add one `.ux/audits/index.md` row per auditor run (append-only),
   exactly as a single-auditor run does.

5. **Write the roll-up.** Create `.ux/audits/rollup-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>.md`: a per-auditor
   severity table, the auditors that ran vs. were skipped (with reasons — including a
   CUJ run skipped for want of `.ux/cujs/`, and web performance skipped when not opted into,
   with its opt-in reason), a merged top-issues list ordered by severity across all
   auditors, and an overall **go/no-go verdict** (e.g. no-go if any sev4, or any auditor
   reports a sev3 blocker — a CUJ sev4 is a blocked journey and forces no-go). A skipped CUJ
   run, or a web-performance run not opted into, is disclosed, never scored as a pass. Link
   to each individual report.

6. **Self-check.** Validate every report and the index with
   [`scripts/validate_report.py`](../../scripts/validate_report.py), and confirm the safety
   invariant with [`scripts/audit_safety.py`](../../scripts/audit_safety.py) `<host-repo>`.

7. **Render the HTML companions.** Generate a self-contained HTML view for every member
   report, the roll-up dashboard (with its go/no-go verdict and per-auditor matrix linking to
   each member's `.html`), and the index landing page:

   ```
   python3 scripts/render_report_html.py .ux/audits/*.md
   python3 scripts/render_report_html.py --index .ux/audits/index.md
   ```

   Each `.html` is a derived view of its Markdown, written under `.ux/audits/` — the safety
   invariant holds. (Also available on demand via `/ux-review`.)

## Boundaries

- **Findings only.** No auditor in the roll-up edits host application code.
- **Never write outside `.ux/audits/`** in the host repo — the suite-wide safety invariant.
- **Ask first** before starting a dev server, navigating a browser, or installing anything
  (including a missing wrapped skill — offer, don't auto-install).
- **Never fabricate**, and honor each wrapped auditor's own honesty rules (usability's
  render-vs-source; web performance's metric-honesty).

## Exit criteria (done when)

- Each selected, available auditor produced a contract-valid report under `.ux/audits/`,
  with one appended index row apiece.
- A `rollup-<timestamp>.md` exists with the per-auditor table, skipped auditors (with
  reasons), merged issues, and a go/no-go verdict.
- Every report validates; `audit_safety.py` reports all changes confined to `.ux/audits/`.
