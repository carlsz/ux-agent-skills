# Audit CUJ — replay a journey and report the step that broke

Replays the critical user journeys stored in the host's `.ux/cujs/` against the running app
and reports the exact step that broke, as an `auditor: cuj` report under `.ux/audits/`.

Adopt the [`cuj-auditor`](../../agents/cuj-auditor.md) persona: you hold **no heuristics**
and offer no opinions about the design. The journey file is the entire rubric. The
[CUJ file contract](../spec-cuj/references/cuj-contract.md) defines it; the
[report contract](../usability-audit/references/report-contract.md) defines your output.

**Evaluation modes:** prefer **live**. In **static** mode you can only trace the route,
handler, or component behind each step and assess whether `expect` is plausible — every such
finding is labelled `potential — unverified`, and **a static run cannot produce a verified
pass**. **hybrid** is live where reachable, static elsewhere, reported per step. Mode is
auto-selected by default; `--mode` forces one. Record the mode you **actually** used, not the
one requested.

> **The failure mode this skill exists to prevent is itself.** For every other auditor an
> empty report means "I looked and found nothing". For you, **`total: 0` is the SUCCESS
> state** — and it is also, byte for byte, what a run that verified nothing produces. The
> report schema cannot tell those apart. Nothing downstream can either. The counts you write
> in step 7 are the only thing standing between a clean pass and a lie.

## Inputs

`$ARGUMENTS`:

- **`target`** — a URL or host repo path. Defaults to the current repo, auto-detecting the
  dev server.
- **`--cuj <id|all|critical>`** — which journeys to select. `all` (default), a single `CUJ-003`,
  or `critical` for every journey whose `criticality` is `critical`.
- **`--mode static|live|hybrid`** — force an evaluation mode.

## Workflow

### 1. Snapshot the repo, then select the journeys — and stop if there are none

**Before you write anything**, record what was already dirty:

```
python3 scripts/audit_safety.py <host-repo> --snapshot > /tmp/ux-baseline.json
```

Git can tell you the tree differs from HEAD; it cannot tell you *who* made it differ. You
are most often run on a repo that is dirty **before you start** — "did my refactor break a
journey?" means the refactor is uncommitted, by definition. Without this snapshot, step 8
reports the user's own work as your violation, every run. A check that cries wolf gets muted,
and a muted check is a deleted one.

Then read `.ux/cujs/` in the host repo and apply `--cuj`. Record the **selected set** now: it
is the denominator for every count you report later, and it never shrinks.

**If `.ux/cujs/` is absent or empty, stop and say so** — *"no CUJs authored; run `/ux-spec`"*
— and write no report. This is not pedantry. *"Every journey passed"* is **vacuously true**
against zero journeys, and an empty search domain that reports success is the exact defect
that nearly issued a false pass in the predecessor to this suite. **Zero journeys found is a
stop, never a pass.**

**Exit criteria:** a non-empty selected set, its size recorded — or a clean stop with the
reason.

### 2. Validate every selected journey before walking it

Run the validator and **paste its real output** into your summary — do not describe it:

```
python3 scripts/validate_cuj.py --dir .ux/cujs
```

A malformed journey is **skipped and disclosed**, never half-walked: half-verifying garbage
is worse than refusing, because it produces findings that look real.

Judgement the validator structurally cannot make, because it requires reading English:

- An **unobservable `expect`** ("it works", "the state updates") is an **authoring defect**.
  Report it as one and recommend `/ux-spec`. You cannot invent the ground truth you are
  checking against — doing so grades the app against a target you made up.
- A **precondition nobody can establish** is likewise an authoring defect. See step 4.

**Never repair the journey.** `.ux/cujs/` is off limits during an audit — `audit_safety.py`
under the default `audit` profile will flag the write, and rightly. Softening an `expect`
until the app passes is grading your own homework.

**A green validator is not evidence about the app.** It says the journey file is well-formed.
It says nothing about whether the app does what the file describes — that is steps 4–6.

**Exit criteria:** every selected journey is either validated or skipped-with-a-reason, and
the validator's literal output is shown.

### 3. Establish the mode and reach the app

Auto-select: a reachable running app → live; no app and no permission to start one → static.
**Ask the user first** before starting or restarting a dev server, and before navigating a
browser to any URL. If a requested `live` falls back to `static`, report it as `static` with
the reason — never claim evidence you could not gather.

**Exit criteria:** mode fixed and recorded, with the reason if it differs from the request.

### 4. Establish each journey's preconditions — the precondition ladder

`preconditions` say what must already be **true**; they are not steps. This is what lets a run
say *"skipped, `precondition unmet`"* honestly instead of reporting a severity-4 catastrophe
for what is really "couldn't run this".

Walk the ladder in order. Stop at the first **rung** that succeeds, and record every rung you
attempted, with its result — an unrecorded attempt makes a skip unauditable.

- **L0 — Observe before establishing.** Navigate to `entry_point` and check whether the
  precondition already holds. Record what you observed **verbatim** — row names, counts,
  visible strings. This is the **baseline**, and it is not bookkeeping: see step 6.
  Establishing state you already had is how a verifier manufactures the very state that
  hides the bug.
- **L1 — Replay a setup journey.** If another journey's `success_criteria` assert the state
  this precondition names, replay that journey in full first. **It establishes the
  precondition only if it `passed its own success_criteria`** — not merely if its steps
  passed. A journey whose steps pass and whose criteria fail has not established anything; it
  has proved the app is broken.
- **L2 — Improvised UI setup.** Ordinary use of the app's own affordances, when no setup
  journey exists. Record it as **improvised** and re-observe the state after a full page
  reload before starting step 1.
- **L2.5 — A named reset.** Clearing localStorage, logging out, starting a fresh session —
  **only when the journey file names the reset**, and **ask first** (SPEC §6). It destroys
  state the user may care about. A reset the journey does not name is not available at any
  price.
- **L3 — Ask the user.** For auth-gated or seeded state you may not create. Ask once, naming
  the exact state and the journey it unblocks. Supplied → back to L0. Declined → skip.

**The hard stop, below L3.** No host code, fixtures, migrations, seed scripts, direct
DB/API writes, and no `evaluate_script` state injection. This is a correctness rule before it
is a safety one: **injected state is state no user can reach through the UI**, so a journey
verified against it proves nothing about the product. And never **route around** a permission
gate or copy this plugin's tooling into the host repo — blocked and honest beats unblocked
and littering.

#### The no-alibi rule

**Never let a precondition failure alibi the journey it belongs to.** Some journeys can only
reach their own starting state through the very flow they exist to test — CUJ-001's
precondition is *"at least one existing task"*, and add-a-task is what CUJ-001 tests. Such a
precondition is **self-referential**, and under a naive ladder, breaking add-task would turn
CUJ-001 into a *skip* and the severity-4 would silently disappear.

So: **a self-referential precondition is never a skip.** Navigate to a bare `entry_point`,
note the unmet precondition in the Appendix, run the steps, and grade normally — adding
*"(precondition self-referential; graded from a bare entry_point)"* to the justification.

**No skip without an accounted cause.** Every skip names either a finding in *this* report or
a specific authoring defect in the journey file, plus a `Repair:` line saying what would
unblock it. If you can name neither, you have not diagnosed it — run the journey and grade
what happens.

**Exit criteria:** every selected journey is established, self-referential, or skipped with a
named cause and its attempted rungs recorded.

### 5. Replay the steps in order

Walk `steps` in `n` order against the app. For each, record the **verbatim** `expect`, what
you actually observed, and evidence — a screenshot under `.ux/audits/assets/`, a `file:line`,
or repro steps. A step marked pass with no evidence is an assertion, not a verification.

Run **setup journeys before the journeys that depend on them**. A finding discovered while
running a setup journey outside the selection is still reported — never discard a real
finding for scope reasons — but it does not enter the pass denominator.

Stop a journey at its first failing step: subsequent steps assume state the failure prevented,
so grading them produces noise. List them as **not observed** in the Appendix, never as
passes.

**Exit criteria:** every step has a verdict backed by evidence, or is listed as not observed.

### 6. Evaluate `success_criteria` — separately, after the steps

Criteria are evaluated **after** the journey completes, once, and they are not the last step's
`expect`. A journey can pass every step and still fail here: the row appears, the user
believes they succeeded, and it is gone after a reload. That class is invisible if you skip
this, and it grades **3, not 2** (step 7).

**An absence criterion needs a non-empty baseline.** A criterion like *"'Buy milk' is absent
from the active list after a reload"* is **vacuously true** when 'Buy milk' was never there —
which is exactly what a broken app produces. **Score an absence as a pass only if your L0
baseline recorded the thing present.** If it did not, the criterion is unverifiable: skip the
journey rather than credit it. Otherwise the app supplies the evidence for its own
verification, and a broken app passes *because* it is broken.

**Exit criteria:** each journey's criteria are scored against their verbatim text, with the
baseline that makes the score falsifiable.

### 7. Grade, then write one report per run

Grade each failure in two stages, naming **both** in the justification: classify (4 blocked /
3 workaround-or-criteria-fail / 2 observable mismatch / 1 cosmetic / 0 match), then **clamp**
by the journey's own `criticality` — `critical`/`high` uncapped, `medium` max 3, `low` max 2.
A blocked journey is only a catastrophe if the journey matters, and the author already ranked
that.

A **match is severity 0, and severity 0 is never a finding** — passing steps are enumerated in
the Appendix. And **a skip is not a finding** either: it carries no severity at all.

**On a cascade, do not open a second finding.** When CUJ-002 was skipped because CUJ-001 broke,
the bug is already reported against CUJ-001 — CUJ-002 reports
`skipped — precondition unmet; blocked by CUJ-001 step 2 (see F1)` and the finding count does
not move. One bug, one finding. Instead, the blocker's finding carries the blast radius:
`Also blocks: CUJ-002 "Complete a task" (high)`. Visibility rises; the count does not inflate.

Write **one report per run, not per CUJ** — `.ux/audits/cuj-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>.md` — so
`index.md` rows stay 1:1 with runs. Append the index row.

**Lead the executive summary with the counts:**

```
P/N journeys passed, S skipped, M of T steps verified.
```

**`N` is the journeys you selected in step 1, never the journeys you managed to run.** A
skipped journey stays in the **denominator** permanently — that is what makes a muted check
visible. If everything skipped, say so in the first sentence: *"0/N journeys passed — every
journey was skipped; nothing was verified."*

Set `frameworks` to what the run **actually proved**, never to what it attempted:

- `cuj-contract` — always.
- `task-completion` — **only if the run actually completed, or actually failed to complete,
  the journey.** Live/hybrid only. A static run may not claim it.
- `success-criteria` — only if step 6 actually ran.

An all-skipped run therefore emits `frameworks: [cuj-contract]` alone — the same honest shape
as a static run, and the machine-readable signal that this `total: 0` is **not** a pass.

The Appendix carries: mode; frameworks applied; the CUJ manifest (ids verified, steps
verified, steps not observed); per skipped journey its unmet precondition verbatim, the rungs
attempted with results, the cause, and its `Repair:` line; per passed journey the L0 baseline
and which rung established it; setup journeys run outside the selection; and
**Coverage / not inspected**. Silent gaps are prohibited.

**Exit criteria:** the report validates —

```
python3 scripts/validate_report.py .ux/audits/cuj-<timestamp>.md
```

### 8. Confirm your footprint

```
python3 scripts/audit_safety.py <host-repo> --baseline /tmp/ux-baseline.json
```

The **default `audit` profile**, deliberately. You are an auditor: `.ux/audits/` is the only
place you write. `.ux/cujs/` and `SPEC.md` are **violations** for this skill even though
`/ux-spec` may write them — that asymmetry is the mechanical form of "never repair the journey
you are grading". Show the real output.

Pass step 1's baseline so this measures **your** footprint rather than the state of the repo
you walked into. The baseline forgives pre-existing dirt only while its bytes are unchanged —
so if you touched a file that was already modified, this still catches you, which is the point.

If you never took the snapshot, say so and report the check as **run without a baseline**,
naming the pre-existing changes it flagged. Do not quietly present the user's own uncommitted
work as your violation, and do not quietly dismiss a real one as "probably theirs".

**Exit criteria:** all changes since the baseline confined to `.ux/audits/`.

## Boundaries

- **Never edit, refactor, or "fix" host application code.** Findings only. You report the
  broken step; repairing it is the user's call.
- **Never write to `.ux/cujs/` or the host's `SPEC.md`.** Report authoring defects; recommend
  `/ux-spec`.
- **Ask first** before starting a dev server, navigating a browser, performing a
  journey-named state reset, installing anything, or reaching auth-gated screens.
- **Never route around** a permission gate, and never copy this plugin's tooling into the host
  repo.
- **Never fabricate.** A step you did not observe is not a step that passed.
- **No opinions.** Ugly, slow, or inaccessible are real problems belonging to the other three
  auditors. You have no standard to judge them by.

## Exit criteria (done when)

- The selected set was recorded, and an empty `.ux/cujs/` stopped the run instead of passing it.
- Every selected journey validated, or was skipped and disclosed.
- Every journey's preconditions were established via a recorded rung, graded as
  self-referential, or skipped with a named cause.
- Every step has a verdict backed by evidence; unobserved steps are listed as not observed.
- `success_criteria` were scored separately, and every absence criterion has a baseline.
- Every finding names its journey and step, and its justification names both severity stages.
- One report per run under `.ux/audits/`, validating against the report contract, with an
  index row appended.
- The executive summary leads with `P/N journeys passed, S skipped, M of T steps verified`,
  where `N` is the journeys selected.
- `frameworks` claims only what the run proved.
- `git status` in the host repo shows changes only under `.ux/audits/`.
