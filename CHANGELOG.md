# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- **`AGENTS.md`** — how the repo is laid out and how to author new components: the
  three-layer composition rule (moved here from the README), frontmatter per layer, the
  end-to-end checklist for adding an auditor, and the authoring rules the tests enforce.
  `CLAUDE.md` symlinks to it.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — setup, what to work on, PR expectations, and the release process.
- README section on composing with [agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills):
  a report's prioritized-fixes queue feeds `/spec`, `/plan`, or `/build`, then a re-run
  confirms the severity dropped.
- Declared the `web-quality-skills@addy-web-quality-skills` dependency (which the roll-up
  wraps) in `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`, and added the `$schema` reference to both.
- **Evals system** (`evals/`) — modelled on agent-skills' evals, using Sprout as the
  behavioral target. Tier 2 (trigger routing via stemmed TF-IDF over skill descriptions,
  schema + minimums + collision checks) runs deterministically in CI via
  `tests/test_evals.py`; Tier 3 (behavioral audits against Sprout, graded by
  `evals/run_evals.py --grade`) runs on demand. Replaces the ad-hoc dogfood prompt.
- **Suite roll-up** — `/ux-agent-skills:ux-audit` fans out to usability (native) plus
  accessibility and web performance (wrapped from
  [web-quality-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/web-quality-skills)), normalizes every
  result into the shared `.ux/audits` contract, and writes a `rollup-<ts>.md` with a
  per-auditor table and a go/no-go verdict. Unavailable auditors are skipped and disclosed.
- **Usability Auditor** — the suite's first auditor: the `usability-auditor` persona
  (`agents/`), the `usability-audit` skill (`skills/`), and the `/usability-audit`
  command (`commands/`).
- Static, live (browser), and hybrid (auto-selecting) evaluation modes, with a
  render-vs-source honesty rule (static-mode runtime claims labeled
  `potential — unverified`).
- Four evaluation frameworks — Nielsen's 10, Shneiderman's 8, AI Design Heuristics, and
  NPCIS — with findings de-duplicated and attributed to a primary framework.
- **Shared `.ux/audits` report contract** every future suite auditor inherits: frontmatter
  schema, 0–4 severity rubric, body layout, rolling `index.md`, and coverage-honesty rule.
- `scripts/validate_report.py` (report + index + coverage validation, per-auditor
  framework vocabularies) and `scripts/audit_safety.py` (safety-invariant check).
- Test suites: contract, component-structure, safety/idempotency, and docs/link checks.
- Moved `nng-ux-heuristics.md` into the skill's `references/` so the skill is self-contained.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Bootstrap plugin scaffolding: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` catalog.
- Component skeleton with placeholder docs: `agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/`.
- MIT `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, and this changelog.
- `references/` seed material (NN/g heuristics, heuristic-evaluator persona spec).
