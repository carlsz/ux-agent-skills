# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Suite roll-up** — `/ux-agent-skills:ux-audit` fans out to usability (native) plus
  accessibility and web performance (wrapped from
  [web-quality-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/web-quality-skills)), normalizes every
  result into the shared `.ux/audits` contract, and writes a `rollup-<ts>.md` with a
  per-auditor table and a go/no-go verdict. Unavailable auditors are skipped and disclosed.
- **Usability Auditor** — the suite's first auditor: the `usability-auditor` persona
  (`agents/`), the `usability-audit` skill (`skills/`), and the `/usability-audit`
  command (`commands/`).
- Static, live (browser), and hybrid (auto-selecting) evaluation modes, with a
  render-vs-source honesty rule (static-mode runtime claims labeled
  `potential — unverified`).
- Four evaluation frameworks — Nielsen's 10, Shneiderman's 8, AI Design Heuristics, and
  NPCIS — with findings de-duplicated and attributed to a primary framework.
- **Shared `.ux/audits` report contract** every future suite auditor inherits: frontmatter
  schema, 0–4 severity rubric, body layout, rolling `index.md`, and coverage-honesty rule.
- `scripts/validate_report.py` (report + index + coverage validation, per-auditor
  framework vocabularies) and `scripts/audit_safety.py` (safety-invariant check).
- Test suites: contract, component-structure, safety/idempotency, and docs/link checks.
- Moved `nng-ux-heuristics.md` into the skill's `references/` so the skill is self-contained.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Bootstrap plugin scaffolding: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` catalog.
- Component skeleton with placeholder docs: `agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/`.
- MIT `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, and this changelog.
- `references/` seed material (NN/g heuristics, heuristic-evaluator persona spec).
